<p style="text-align:center;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 350%;">Our plan!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 250%;">Our plan is to move patients who are waiting to be discharged into a seperate room so that frees up more beds for new patients. We also hope to raise funding to help buy more beds for hospitals that will be put into semi-private rooms and if needed we will make private rooms semi-private. Doing this will ensure that everyone who walks in will be put into a bed so that even if they are waiting, they will be comfortable will does help them mentally and physically. This however is just a short-term goal and in the future we hope to be able to raise enough funding to open up more emergency rooms as many have closed in the past decade being one cause of the E.R's filling up.</p>
